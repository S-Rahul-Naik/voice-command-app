I can upload the project to a service and give you a direct download link. Want me to do that?

## 📱 **OR - Simplest Solution: Use Pre-Built Version**

Since the Android app build is complex, would you like me to:

1. **Create a simpler WebView version** that wraps your existing web app?
2. **Give you instructions to use MIT App Inventor** (visual, no-code)?
3. **Help you install Android Studio** and build locally?
